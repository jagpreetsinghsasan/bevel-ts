# Bevel Typescript
This project is inspired from [Hyperledger Bevel](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel), taking the core principals of Hyperledger Bevel in the flavour of TS.

Re-wiring the tech stalk, optimizing the code-flow and re-imagining the core principles of Hyperleger Bevel are the main objectives of this side-project.
